# Modern software development can drive innovation to new heights

To get there, developers need tools that are built to handle today’s challenges and future demands. While some organizations lag behind, read on—and learn how you can get started and leverage these capabilities to streamline development, strengthen security, and unlock more innovation for your organization.

## Improve your engineering systems with custom dev environments

Dev Box dramatically speeds up developer onboarding over physical machines and VDI, as we saw in this GigaOM study. However, developers rarely work only on a single project. Developers often work across multiple projects.

In contrast, Dev Box breaks from the status quo to empower developers to take a highly efficient “task-based” development approach, and use different dev boxes pre-configured for different projects.

Team customizations enable dev team leads to easily create ready-to-code Dev Box configurations for their entire team—they just write a configuration file once and everyone benefits. Once a dev box is created, team members can start coding immediately.

But Dev Box goes even further to help dev teams scale and support the most demanding, wide-ranging development needs. Dev Box imaging now enables dev team leads to convert team customizations directly into images for even faster deployment.

Dev Box also now enables development teams to leverage new native support for Winget, Desired State Configuration (DSC), and PowerShell when using team customizations, speeding up the time to install and configure development environments.

## Enhance security while managing large and diverse dev teams

The team-based customization capabilities we just introduced are in large part thanks to the project management layer built into Dev Box. This level of management not only gives dev leads and the admin team greater control over resources, but also enhances security.

Today, we’re excited to announce expanded project policy management that applies these controls to even more resources. Admins can now manage access to Dev Box components like images, scripts, and more.

Admin oversight in Dev Box isn’t just limited to managing cloud resources. With new Dev Box instances automatically enrolled in Microsoft Intune, admins can manage dev boxes like any other device in their organization.

Additionally, we continue to expand how admins can use Azure Monitor with Dev Box, and now offer Dev Box usage metrics for greater visibility into the ways developers are (or aren’t) using their dev boxes.

## Get the performance and resilience of a like-local developer experience

Our goal with Dev Box has always been to deliver the best experience possible for developers and continue finding new ways to enhance the usability and performance of the service. Already, Dev Box delivers a smooth like-local experience to developers.

Region selection optimization in dev box creation, coming soon, is one way Dev Box delivers this experience. This feature recommends an optimal region based on a developer’s location for the best performance.

In addition to improving performance, we also continue to streamline the getting-started experience in Dev Box for developers. Earlier this year, we announced that developers can start coding faster with a simplified setup process.

Finally, if you’ve been following our Dev Box journey, you’ll know we’re dramatically expanding our Dev Box usage at Microsoft. Today, we have over 35,000 developers using Dev Box internally.

## Beyond VDI—future-ready workstations for innovative app development

From what we’ve seen internally and with customers, we’re optimistic about Dev Box’s potential to meet the evolving needs of developers and admins with productive, secure cloud development environments.
