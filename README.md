  <h1>Microsoft Dev Box Lab Series</h1>
</div>

## Overview
The following lab guide is broken down into the tasks required by each persona that plays a role in the lifecycle of Microsoft Dev Box. 
To complete the entire series of labs you must complete each persona's tasks. We will be using the Azure portal to provision the Azure services as a learning exercise. In a real-world scenario this would be done through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

The three personas we cover are:
-   **IT / Dev Infra Team Member** (IT Admin)
-   **Dev Team Lead** (Development Manager)
-   **Developer**

The diagram below outlines the structure we will be building. It represents an organisation, HQ'd in the UK, with developers in India and the UK. The developers are building 2 projects:
- **Project A** is developed by UK developers and requires *VSCode*.
- **Project B** is developed by both UK and Indian developers and requires *M365 apps*. 

Feel free to adapt this scenario to match your use case!

# Pre-lab setup

The steps in this lab guide assume that you have access to an **M365 tenant** with **Microsoft E5 licenses** (or equivalent) provisioned.

The lab guide also assumes that your tenant contains at least one **Azure Subscription where you are the owner**. 
In some places the lab guide assumes that you have provisioned a set of M365 demo accounts. This is not necessary but encouraged to make it easier to follow the instructions.

You should use your tenant's **global administrator account** for the pre-lab tasks.
This is the account that you created when setting up the Microsoft 365 tenant. (youradmin@yourrandomaad.onmicrosoft.com) 
It is not one of the pre-existing demo accounts such as *Adele Vance* or *Alex Wilber*.

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Set up your environment for the lab.</summary>

Please work through the below steps before starting the first lab.

## Designate your user accounts for this and future labs 
-   Log into the Azure Portal with your global administrator account

-   Go to "Azure Active Directory".

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image1.png" width="75%" /></div>

-   Select the "Users" blade in the side bar and review the user
    accounts

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image2.png" width="75%" /></div>

-   Pick two user accounts that aren’t admins for this lab. **They should be dummy accounts and not assigned to actual people**. For this and all following labs we will use Adele as the Development Manager persona and Alex as the Developer persona. You may however pick any other user account that exists in the tenant.

> **Note:**
> At the time of writing Microsoft Dev Box does not support guest accounts. This feature is on the roadmap and until it is available, you cannot use guest accounts for some of the tasks outlined.

> **Note:**
> If you do not see any user accounts or only guest and admin accounts here, then your tenant has not got any user profiles pre-provisioned. You can create user accounts by going to the [M365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/users and logging in with your global administrator account. When creating user accounts there, you get the option to assign them an E5 licence which is required to use Microsoft Dev Box.

-   **For each user account** (in our case Adele and Alex)

    -   Click the user's name in the blade
    -   A separate user blade will load
    -   Click "Reset Password" and make a note of the user's principal name and password for future steps.
    -   We recommend saving these in a Notepad for the duration of this Level-Up.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image4.png" width="75%" /></div>

> **Note:**
> When you log into the Azure Portal with these user accounts in later tasks you will need to create a new password for them. Should you forget the new password you set you can follow these steps again to reset their password once again.

> **Note:**
> We do not recommend writing passwords down in a digital plaintext format in production scenarios. We are doing it here to optimize the speed at which you can move through the lab activities.
</details><br>


# Lab 1 IT Admin Persona

Please perform the following steps as your **global administrator account**. The steps in this lab will take you about 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete.

The first step is to create a range of resources that we will need so our Dev Manager can create Projects which will in turn enable their developers to spin up Dev Boxes.

## Create a virtual network for UK and India Dev teams
<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a Virtual Network resource called "uk-vnet" inside a resource group named "dev-center-network" in uksouth. Do the same for "india-vnet" in centralindia</summary>

-   In the Azure Portal go to the "Create a resource" menu which can be found by clicking the menu button in the top left corner of the screen and choosing "Create a resource"
-   Once in the menu search "Virtual Network" on the create pane as shown. Click "Create"

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image6.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Name the network resource **uk-vnet**  and create a new resource group called **"dev-center-network"**.
-   We want to keep all of our core Dev Center resources **in one Azure Region** to maximize performance. For Dev Boxes we want to place them close to our developers in the UK and India. You'll see how this is done shortly.
-   Select *UK South* as the location.
    At the time of writing the following Regions are available:

    -   South Africa North
    -   East Asia
    -   Southeast Asia
    -   Australia East
    -   Brazil South
    -   Canada Central
    -   North Europe
    -   West Europe
    -   Germany West Central
    -   Central India
    -   Italy North
    -   Japan East
    -   Korea Central
    -   Sweden Central
    -   Switzerland North	
    -   UK South
    -   Central US	
    -   East US
    -   East US 2
    -   South Central US
    -   West US 3

You can find the latest regional availability [here](https://aka.ms/devbox/regions)

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image7.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   For the purposes of the demo environment that we are creating we can leave all other options as they are and click **"Review & Create".**
-   Confirm the details and start the deployment.
-   Repeat this for the Indian Dev team creating a vnet called "india-vnet" in *India Central*.
</details>

## Create a network connection
<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a Network Connection resource called "uk-con" with "Azure active directory join" enabled inside a resource group named "dev-center-core" attached to the Virtual Network previously created. Do the same for an "india-con" Network Connection</summary>

Once the network is deployed, we need to create network connections that we'll be able to leverage for our dev boxes.

-   In the Azure Portal, **go back to the "Create a resource" blade** and search for "Network Connection". Once you find the "Network connection" resource, click **Create**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image8.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Click **"Create"** again.

-   On the next blade, create a new resource group for the connection. Call it **"dev-center-core"**.

-   Ensure that **"Azure Active Directory join"** is selected

-   Call the connection **"uk-con"** and select the UK network that was created in the previous step

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image9.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Click **"Review & Create"** and confirm the deployment by clicking **"Create"**.
-   Repeat this for the Indian Dev team creating a connection called **"india-con"** attaching it to the *India-vnet* vnet.
</details>

## Create a Dev Center
<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a Dev Center resource called "dev-center-uk01" inside the "dev-center-core" resource group, and attach the previously created Network Connections.</summary>

In the Azure Portal, **go back to the "Create a resource" blade** and in the search box, type **"Dev Center"** and then select "Dev Center" from the list. Click the **"Create"** option.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image10.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Choose the existing **"dev-center-core"** resource group for your deployment and call it **"dev-center-uk01"**.

-   Select *UK South* as the Azure region.

-   Review the deployment and confirm its creation.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image11.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   After a few moments the Dev center resource should appear in the Azure portal. Navigate to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group to find it.

## Attach the network connections

-   Once the dev center resource appears in the resource group select it to bring up its resource blade.

-   To attach your network connections, select **"Networking"**, then click **"Add network connection"** and select the *uk-con* network connection resource that you created in the previous task. Click the **"Add"** button.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image12.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Once the process is complete a status message like the one shown below should appear.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image13.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Repeat the process for the India Network Connection.
-   The Dev center now knows how to connect new Dev Boxes to your Azure virtual network. Next, we need to create dev box definitions.
</details>

## Create Dev Box definitions with built-in VM images 
<details>
  <summary>TASK: In the Dev Center resource, create a "Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 21H2" Dev Box definition with 8vCPUs and 256GB RAM. Do the same for a "Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise On Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 24H2" Dev Box definition.</summary>

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
-   To create a new dev box definition, select **"Dev box definitions"** blade in the side bar.
-   Select the **"Create"** option in the blade that appears.
-   We will call our definition the **"standard-m365"** definition.

-   Select the **"Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 21H2"** image as this includes standard office apps and teams for you to try later.
-   Select the **"latest"** image version
-   Select **8 vCPUs and 256 GB of RAM**, or the smallest available
-   Select the **smallest storage option** to keep costs low

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image23.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Click the **"Create"** button. This makes the definition available to managers in the organization to select for their projects.
-   Once back on the main blade the **"Image Status"** may show as "pending" for a few moments but should soon update to "No errors found"
-   Repeat the process to create a **"Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise On Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 24H2"** Dev Box definition called **"standard-vscode"**
</details>

## Assign permissions to the Dev Manager and Developer personas

As a final step in this lab, we will give permissions to our Dev Manager account to manage the projects that they are working on. We will also give our Developer the ability to create Dev Boxes for both projects and create a deployment target for them to use later.

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a Project resource called "Project A" in the Dev Center. Assign Adele the "DevCenter Project Admin" role, and Alex the "DevCenter Dev Box User" role. Give both users the "Reader" role. Repeat for "Project B"</summary>

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
-   On the "Overview" blade select the **"Create Project"** button

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image36.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Create a project called "Project A", add a description, and hit **"Create"**
-   Repeat the process for "Project B".

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image37.png" width="50%" /></div>

Once the projects are created, we need to assign roles to them.

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select the newly created *Project A* resource.
-   You can either select the **"Set project access - Edit access"** button on the **"Overview"** blade or select **"Access Control (IAM)"** in the side bar.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image38.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Assign the "Development Manager" (Adele) the **"DevCenter Project Admin"** role and the **"Owner"** role by going to the **"Role Assignment"** tab and picking the roles and then selecting her user identity.

> **Note**: The reason why we add the "**Owner**" role here is to allow the "Development Manager (Adele)" to add a developer in the team to a Dev Box Project as a "dev box user" role.  [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-manage-dev-box-projects#permissions) is the reference to the permissions required to manage a dev box project.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image39.png" width="50%" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image58.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Follow the same steps to give the "Developer" (Alex) the **"DevCenter Dev Box User"** role and the **"Reader"** role on the project resource.
-   Repeat these steps for *Project B*. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a resource group named "dev-center-deployment-target" and assign roles to make Adele the "Owner", and Alex a "Contributor".</summary>
Finally, we also want to create a target environment for deployment via the dev box at a later stage.

-   Use the **"Create"** menu to create a new resource group called **"dev-center-deployment-target"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image41.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Continue to use the same region as before
-   Once the resource group is deployed, access its blade via the portal and go to the **"Access Control (IAM)"** pane via the side bar.
-   Go through the same role assignment process that you just completed, but this time...
    -   ...add the development manager as an Owner
    -   ...add the developer as a Contributor

> **Note:** The development manager persona would most likely perform this second step, but we're doing it on the admin user here for efficiency.
</details><br>

**This lab is now complete!**

# Lab 2 Development Manager Persona

The steps in this lab will take you about 15 minutes to complete.

> We recommend that you remain logged in as the Admin account in your main browser window and open a separate "Incognito/InPrivate" window to perform the upcoming actions as the "Development Manager" (Adele) persona.

<details>
  <summary>TASK: On behalf of the Dev Team Manager, create Dev Box pools for Project A and Project B to address our use case.</summary>

-   Using the credentials that you noted down in the previous lab, **log into the Azure Portal as the "Development Manager"** and perform any tasks necessary to reset your password.
-   Once in the Azure Portal select **"All resources"**. You should see only the project resource that we created at the end of the previous lab. If you do not see the project resource, return to the last task of the previous lab and verify that you are using the correct user account and that the user account has the relevant project admin permission.
-   Select the project resource and then select **"Dev box pools"** in the sidebar of the blade that appears.
-   Click the **"Create"** button to create a new definition and complete the form confirming your choices by once again clicking **"Create".**
-   Complete this process for *Project A* and *Project B* pools to match our use case.

|                            | Project A Pool           | Project B Pool           | Project B Pool           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Name                       | Project-A-UK             | Project-B-UK             | Project-B-India          |
| Definition                 | standard-vscode          | standard-m365            | standard-m365            |
| Network Connection         | uk-con                   | uk-con                   | india-con                |
| Dev Box Creator Privileges | Local Admin              | Local Admin              | Local Admin              |
| Licensing                  | [x]                      | [x]                      | [x]                      |

We recommend exploring the **"Learn more about dev box licensing requirements"** link in the "Create" menu while you are waiting for your dev box definitions to validate.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image43.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   The Dev box pools blade will now show the Dev Box pool definitions. Their validation might take a few minutes.
    -   It is a good idea to wait for the completion of the validation as any issues with earlier tasks in the lab will surface now. 
    -   Creating a Dev Box definition requires all components of the Dev Center to work seamlessly together.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image44.png" width="50%" /></div><br>
</details><br>

**This lab is now complete!**

# Lab 3 Developer Persona

The steps in this lab will take you about 20 minutes to complete. This excludes the time that it takes to provision the Dev Box instances which can take between 30 and 90 minutes each.

## Create a Dev Box

<details>
  <summary>TASK: On behalf of the Developer, provision a dev box for Project A, and Project B (India).</summary>

We recommend that you remain logged in as the Admin account in your main browser window and open a separate "Incognito/InPrivate" window to perform the upcoming actions as the "Developer" (Alex) persona.

-   Using the credentials that you noted down from Lab 1, **log into the [Dev Box Portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal) as the "Developer" user (Alex)** and perform any tasks necessary to reset your password.

> **Note:** The Dev Box Portal URL is not the same as the Azure Portal.

-   Once in the Dev Box portal you should see an option to create a new Dev Box.
    -   If you do not see the option, return to the task where you assigned the user permissions and double check that you are logged in with the same account that has the user permissions.
    -   If you need to adjust permissions, it may take up to 5 minutes for them to reflect in the Dev Box portal.
    -   To avoid cached responses always open a new Incognito window and log in again.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image45.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Click the option to **New dev box**
    -   Create a box called **"ProjectB-India-DevBox"** in the **"ProjectB-India"** devbox pool
    -   Create a box called **"ProjectA-UK-DevBox"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image46.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   **Confirm the creation** of both boxes. The Microsoft Dev Box service will now start creating the Dev Boxes. This will take roughly 30 minutes.

**OPTIONAL:** Before you return to the Incognito/InPrivate window where you started the creation of your Dev Boxes, you can check the virtual network that you created as the Admin (M365 tenant admin) user. It should now have two virtual network interfaces attached to it, one for each Dev Box.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image48.png" width="50%" /></div>

**OPTIONAL:** You can also use your Admin (M365 tenant admin) account to log into the [Microsoft Endpoint manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home) where both Dev Boxes will be registered when created. It may take a few minutes for the devices to show up as they are provisioned and it is not until provisioning is finished that all the device details populate in Endpoint Manager.

We will not go into a lot of detail on InTune and its features in this lab, but you can explore the user interface to see the features that are available to you there. It includes things such as auto-provisioning apps to all of your devices or restricting the use of certain apps based on organizational policy.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image49.png" width="50%" /></div>
</details>

## Use a Dev Box for a simple deployment with VSCode
<details>
  <summary>TASK: Using the Project A dev box, create a blank ASP.Net MVC project and deploy it to the "dev-center-deployment-target" resource group.</summary>

-   Return to **the [Dev Box Portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal) as the "Developer" user** **(Alex)** and review the status of your Dev Boxes. Hopefully they have come online while you were away.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image50.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Test the connection experience to **either box via the browser** and the **Remote Desktop Client on your machine**. You may need to download an updated client if the one you have does not work. This is an option from the Dev Box RDP connection menu.
-   Once you have confirmed that both Dev Boxes are working, we will only continue with the **"ProjectA-UK-DevBox"** box for the rest of the lab. Feel free to **delete the "ProjectB-India-DevBox" box at this stage by clicking "..." > "Delete"**
-   Connect to **ProjectA-UK-DevBox** dev box and open **VSCode** which is already pre-installed as part of the VM Image.
-   Once in VSCode open a terminal window  run the following commands to create a new MVC app:

```  
dotnet new mvc -o MyMVCapp
code -r MyMVCapp
```
> If prompted to install the C# Dev Kit, accept.

-   VSCode should now be open with the vanilla MVC program files.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image51.png" width="50%" /></div>

-    Open a terminal window and run the following command to create a deployment package:
```
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./bin/Publish
```
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image52.png" width="50%" /></div>

Next we will deploy the code directly from our Dev Box in VSCode to our *dev-center-deployment-target* resource group.
-   Install the Azure App Service plugin in VSCode by selecting the *Extensions* icon from the left-hand menu, search for "Azure" and selecting *Azure App Service* plugin.
> Note: we could have done this automatically as part of the Dev Box deployment.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image53.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Open the Azure App Service plugin and click the "Sign in to Azure" link, signing in with Alex's credentials.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image54.png" width="50%" /></div>

- Next we create a web app:
  - Expand the subscription that has opened in the App Service plugin window.
  - Right-click App Services and select Create New Web App... (Advanced)
  - Enter a unique name for the web app.
  - Select the "dev-center-deployment-target" resource group created earlier in an earlier lab.
  - Select the most recent stable .NET runtime (such as .NET 9). Do not select the ASP.NET runtime, which is for .NET Framework apps.
  - Select your pricing tier. Free (F1) is acceptable for this tutorial.

- Finally we deploy our app to the newly created App Service:
  - In the VSCode *file* view, right click the "bin\Publish" folder and select "Deploy to Web App..." and follow the prompts.
  - Once the deployment is finished, click *Browse Website* to validate the deployment.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image55.png" width="50%" /></div>

**You have successfully deployed your first application to Azure via a Dev Box!**
</details><br>

**This lab is now complete!**

# Lab 4 Incorporate Customisations
The steps in this lab will take you about 30 minutes to complete.

Getting developers started on a new project or team can be complex and time-consuming. The Microsoft Dev Box *customizations* feature helps you streamline setup of the developer environment.

Individual developers can attach a YAML-based customization file when creating their dev box to control the development environment. Developers should use **individual customizations** only for personal settings and apps. Tasks specified in the individual customization file run only in the user context, after sign-in.

Although teams of developers can share common YAML files, this approach can be inefficient and error prone. It can also be against compliance policies. Dev Box **team customizations** provide a workflow for developer team leaders, project admins, and dev center administrators to preconfigure customization files in dev box pools. This way, a developer who's creating a dev box doesn't need to find and upload a customization file.

> Note: The Dev Box team customizations feature is currently in preview

## Create Team Customisations
To create a dev box using team customisations follow the instructions in this [mslearn article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-team-customizations). This would be the role of the Dev Manager, so you should run this under the Dev Manager persona.

## Create a Reusable Team Customisations Image
Using a customization file simplifies the creation of dev boxes for your team. With dev box customizations, you can create a shared team customization by creating a file called an image definition. Creating a reusable image from this image definition optimizes customizations and saves time during dev box creation. This would be the role of the Dev Manager, so you should run this under the Dev Manager persona.

To configure imaging for dev box team customisations follow the instructions in this [mslearn article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-configure-customization-imaging).

# Lab 5 Configure Dev Box Policies
The steps in this lab will take you about 30 minutes to complete.

As development teams embrace cloud-based tools to accelerate their workflows, managing resources securely and efficiently across different projects has become a top priority. Microsoft Dev Box is designed to streamline project-based development, providing developers with tailored cloud development environments optimized for productivity and collaboration.

Project policies are a powerful new way for platform engineers to set guardrails around resources enabled on a per-project basis, allowing teams to balance flexibility with governance as they work on diverse projects. Project policies provide a mechanism to restrict access to certain resources—specifically, SKUs, Images, and Network Connections—to designated projects. This helps ensure that each project has controlled access to the resources it needs while keeping everything secure, isolated, and streamlined.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/policies.png" width="50%" /></div>

> Note: Dev Box Policies are currently in preview.

> Note: Dev Box Policies apply to *Image Definitions*, NOT *Dev Box Definitions*.

> Note: This lab assumes that you have added a catalog with image definitions to *Project A* during the previous *Customisations* lab. 

In this lab we are going to create a **default** policy that restricts all Dev box projects to the lowest SKU machine. Then we'll create a policy scoped to *Project A* that permits higher SKU machines.

## Create a Default Policy
With project policies, platform engineers have the option to configure a default project policy. Think of this default policy as a foundational layer applied across all projects in your Dev Center. This default policy helps establish baseline rules and ensures consistency in how sub-resources are managed. 

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a default policy that limits SKU to the lowest available, and test it works.</summary>

- Open the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
- In the *Settings* menu select the **"Project policy"** option.
- Click the *Create* button.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/createpolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Select **All current and future projects**. This option will automatically set the name for the project policy to "default".
- Click the **Select SKUs** link, and check the *8vCPU, 32GB RAM, 256 GB SSD* SKU. Hit *Select* to accept your selection.
- Add any other Image, Network, or SKU retrictions you wish, then hit *Create* to create the default policy. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/configuredefaultpolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

Now let's test this default policy.
- Enforce the default policy by checking the relevent resource type checkboxes for the restrictions you created e.g. *SKU*, and hitting *Apply*.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/enforceskupolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Select the *Projects* menu option from the Dev Center **Manage** menu section, and click *Project A* to open the project pane.
- Select the *Dev box pools* menu option from the Project **Manage**  menu section to view / create Dev box pools.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/viewprojectdevboxpools.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Click the *Create* button to display the *Create a dev box* pool pane.
- Give the pool a name, e.g. "Project-A-Default-Policy-Pool".
- From the *Definition* dropdown list, select an *Image Definition*, e.g. "backend-eng".
- Select a compute and storage option. Note that only the *8vCPU, 32GB RAM, 256 GB SSD* option is listed. This is due to the default policy that we just created!
- Go ahead and create the pool, or cancel out of the process - we aren't going to use this pool.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/createpooldefaultpolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

</details>

## Create a Custom Project Policy
After the default project policy is in place, you can create additional policies to address specific needs or restrictions for individual projects. Custom policies allow admins to set guardrails that are unique to the project’s requirements, whether that means offering high-powered SKUs for certain projects or restricting network access based on security considerations.

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a custom policy on Project A that permits a higher SKU machine, and test it works.</summary>

- Return to the *Project policy* blade and click the *Create* button.
- Select *Project A* as the specified project.
- Provide a name for the policy e.g. "Project-A-SKU"

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/createcustompolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Select *16vCPU, 64GB RAM, 256 GB SSD* SKU, then hit *Create* to create the custom policy. This will permit *Project A* Development Managers to define either the default policy 8vCPU machine, or the *Project A* custom 16vCPU SKU. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/createprojectapolicy.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Again, select the *Projects* menu option from the Dev Center **Manage** menu section, and click *Project A* to open the project pane.
- Select the *Dev box pools* menu option from the Project **Manage**  menu section to view / create Dev box pools.
- Click the *Create* button to display the *Create a dev box* pool pane.
- Give the pool a name, e.g. "Project-A-Custom-Policy-Pool".
- From the *Definition* dropdown list, select an *Image Definition*, e.g. "backend-eng".
- Select a compute and storage option. Note that now as an admin, you have the choice of either the default *8vCPU, 32GB RAM, 256 GB SSD* option, or the more powerful *16vCPU, 64GB RAM, 256 GB SSD* SKU. This is due to the new custom policy.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/createpoolcustom.png" width="75%" /></div>

- Go ahead and create the pool, or cancel out of the process - we aren't going to use this pool.

</details><br>

>Note: When policies are enforced, Microsoft Dev Box evaluates the health of existing resource pools against the new policy settings:
- Pool Health Check: Each resource pool is evaluated to determine compliance with the enforced policies.
- Unhealthy Pools: If a pool fails to meet the enforced requirements, it may be marked as unhealthy. This prevents any new Dev Boxes from being created within that pool.
- Existing Dev Boxes Remain Active: Dev Boxes already created within an unhealthy pool will continue to function normally, so your teams can keep working without disruption.

# Lab 6 Create a custom Dev Box definition

While Microsoft Dev Box offers a growing library of images for you to use with *customisations* providing additional flexibility, some scenarios may require you to bring a custom image.

## Create a custom Dev Box definition with VM Image Builder 
Creating custom VM images manually or with other tools can be difficult and unreliable. VM Image Builder, which is built on HashiCorp Packer, offers the advantages of a managed service.

To create a VM image definition in a Compute Gallery follow the instructions in this [mslearn article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-customize-devbox-azure-image-builder).

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Attach the Compute Gallery containing the custom image to Dev Center, and create a Dev Box definition</summary>

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
-   Open the **"Azure compute galleries"** blade, click the **"Add"** button, and select the Compute Gallery named "devboxGallery" created in the mslearn above.
-   To create a Dev Box definition, now select **"Dev box definitions"** in the side bar.
-   Select the **"Create"** option in the blade that appears.
-   We will call this definition the **"custom-vscode"** definition.
-   Click **"See all images"** to make sure the custom image you just added is in the list. **Select it by clicking its name** and confirming with the **"Select"** button.
-   Select the **"latest"** image version
-   Select **8 vCPUs and 32 GB of RAM**
-   Select the **smallest storage option** to keep costs lower
-   Finally click **"Create"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image341.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Wait a few moments while the image is analyzed and confirm that it moves from **"Pending"** to the **"Succeeded/No Errors"** state.
</details>

## Create a custom Dev Box definition with a VM Image
<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a Virtual Machine resource from a Dev Box compatible base image inside a resource group called "image-capture".</summary>

In this section we will run through the **basic steps to capture a custom image**, which we'll then store in an **Azure Compute Gallery** from where our Dev Center will be able to access it.

-   In the Azure Portal, go back to the **"Create a resource"** blade and search for **"Virtual Machine".**
-   Select the **"Virtual Machine"** icon and hit **"Create"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image14.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   In the next screen:
    -   Set the target resource group to be a new resource group called **"image-capture"**.
    -   Give the machine a suitable name.
    -   Set the region to be *uksouth*.
    -   Set **No infrastructure redundancy** and **Standard security**.
    -   Select a Dev Box compatible image from the dropdown. We will install our chosen custom software shortly.
    -   Select a small compute option.
    -   Create a username and password (keep these for later).
    -   Check the licensing confirmation
    -   Confirm all selections and create the virtual machine.
> **Note:** Make sure you select the x64 Gen 2 flavour of the image and not x64 Gen 1, otherwise you will run into issues later in the lab.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image15.png" width="50%" /></div>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image16.png" width="50%" /></div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Run the sysprep utility on the Virtual Machine choosing the "Out-of-Box Experience" to generalize the image, ready for capture.</summary>

Once the deployment is complete head to the new resource group and select the virtual machine.
-   Once on the VM resource blade **choose the option to connect** or copy the IP address into your RDP client.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image17.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Use the credentials that you set in the Create blade earlier and wait for the login process to complete.
-   We will now proceed to creating a custom image from this VM:
    -   Once in Windows 11 on the remote machine, open the start menu and type "Run" in the search bar.
    -   Select the **"Run"** application and type **"sysprep"** into it to navigate to the sysprep folder.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image19.png" width="25%" /></div>

  -   Right-click the **sysprep application** and choose **"Run as administrator"**
  -   In sysprep use the following options
      -   Choose **"Enter System Out-of-Box Experience**" in the cleanup action dropdown
      -   Tick **"Generalize"**
      -   Choose **"Shutdown"** in the shutdown options dropdown

Sysprep will now get to work and eventually shut the machine down. Once that happens the machine is generalized and ready to be converted into a custom VM image.

> **Note:** We are generalizing a newly deployed machine to accelerate this part of the lab. When creating an image yourself you would usually install additional software or make other changes to the image to further customize the experience of the end user.

With the remote session now closed you will find yourself back in your browser window.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Capture the generalized image, making the "dev-center-core" resource group the destination.</summary>

-   Refresh the browser window to ensure that your machine's status says "Stopped", then click the **"Capture"** icon to start capturing an image.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image21.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Because we have not yet created an Azure Compute Gallery for our custom image, we need to go for **"only a managed image"** in the next blade
-   We also want to make sure we select our **"dev-center-core" resource group** as a destination for the image.
-   Choose not to delete the VM for now. **We will ask you to delete it and its resource group later in this lab.**
-   Confirm the creation of the image by clicking **"Review + create"** and confirming the configuration.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image22.png" width="50%" /></div>

Creating the image will take a few minutes to complete. While you are waiting, you can move to the next step where we will create a Dev Box definition with a built-in VM image, before returning to our custom image.
</details>

### Create the Dev Box definition 
> **Note:** you can only complete this step once the custom image has been created in your **dev-center-core** resource group.

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create a user-assigned managed identity in the dev-center-core resource group.</summary>

In this step we will add our managed image to a new Azure Compute gallery so that we can use it with Microsoft Dev Box. To allow our Dev Center to manage images independently we need to also assign a Managed Identity to the resource.

You will need to create a **user-assigned managed identity** resource for your **"DevCenter-Core"** resource group. This managed identity resource is used to allow the Dev Center to manage images in the collection that we'll attach to it in an upcoming step.

-   Navigate back to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group.
-   Open the **"Create"** menu and type "User assigned", then select the "User Assigned Managed Identity" resource and choose **"Create".**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image24.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Call the resource **"dev-center-id"** and place it in the **dev-center-core** resource group.
-   Set the region to your chosen region.
-   Choose the **"Review + Create"** option and **confirm the creation** of the resource.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image25.png" width="50%" /></div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Assign the previously created identity to the Dev Center resource.</summary>

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
-   Select **"Identity**" in the side bar and then select the **"User assigned"** tab and click **"Add"**
-   Select the managed identity object that you created at the start of this task, then select **"Add"**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image26.png" width="50%" /></div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Create an Azure Compute Gallery and add the VM image definition captured previously. Ensure that security type is "Trusted Launch". Add a version.</summary>

In order to use our custom image that we created previously with our **Dev Center** we need to place it in an **Azure Compute Gallery**.

-   In the Azure Portal open the **"Create"** menu once again and search for **"Compute Gallery".**
-   Select **"Create"** to start creating your compute gallery.
-   Call the gallery resource **"computegallery"** and choose the **"dev-center-core"** resource group.
-   Ensure that you are still using **the same Azure region** that you have been using throughout the lab.
-   Finally click **"Review and Create"** and **confirm the creation of the resource**. It will take a few moments for the compute gallery to show up in the resource group.
-   Once the deployment completes **go to its resource blade**, where we'll add the image.
-   Once on the resource blade, select **"Add"** and then select **"VM image definition"** to start the process of adding an image.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image28.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   In the creation blade, choose "**customDevImage"** as the definition name.
-   Ensure that you **maintain the same Azure region where your image is located**.
-   Ensure that you have chosen **"Windows" as the platform**. Dev Box does not support Linux images.
-   You must configure the security type as **"Trusted Launch"** for compatibility reasons but can pick all other options based on your personal preference.
-   The image has been **generalized** for you and the **architecture** to pick is **x64**.
-   You can come up with **your own values for "Publisher", "Offer" and "SKU".** You use these values to search for your image in large galleries and to provision machines programmatically. An example might be: the publisher **"Microsoft"**, releases their **"Windows"** offer of the SKU **"Developer-Win11-VSCode"**
-   Once you are done **confirm all dialogues and create the definition**.

> **Note:** The underlying Windows 365 platform requires all image definitions to use "Trusted Launch" as their security type.

It will take a few moments for this process to complete.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image29.png" width="50%" /></div>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image292.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Once your definition has been created return to the **resource blade** of the compute gallery.

-   Select the **"Definitions"** tab where your definition should now show up.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image30.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Click the name of the definition which will take you to the **definition's blade.**
-   Once on the blade choose the option to **"Add version"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image31.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   You will land on another blade where you can add your managed image. To do this, select **"Managed Image"** for the **Source**. You should then be able to **pick the image you created** earlier as the **"Source Image"**
-   **Pick a version number** for the image. It can be any version number, for example: "1.0.0"
-   Confirm by clicking **"Review and Create"** and **confirming the creation**.
-   This process will take a few minutes and the image version will eventually show up in the "versions" tab of the image definition blade.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image32.png" width="50%" /></div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>TASK: Add the Azure Compute Gallery to the Dev Center and create a Dev Box definition for both the custom image and the built-in image.</summary>

While we wait for this process to complete, we can start creating dev box definitions that leverage both our custom and the built-in images.
The first step will be to make our Dev Center aware of our custom image gallery.

-   Return to the **"dev-center-core"** resource group in the Azure Portal and select your Dev Center resource.
-   First select **"Azure Compute Galleries"** in the side bar and use the **"Add compute gallery"** button to add the gallery you just created.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image33.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   To create a second Dev Box definition, select **"Dev box definitions"** in the side bar.
-   Select the **"Create"** option in the blade that appears.
-   We will call this definition the **"custom-vscode"** definition.
-   Click **"See all images"** to make sure the custom image you just added is in the list. **Select it by clicking its name** and confirming with the **"Select"** button.
-   Select the **"latest"** image version
-   Select **8 vCPUs and 32 GB of RAM**
-   Select the **smallest storage option** to keep costs lower
-   Finally click **"Create"**

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image341.png" width="50%" /></div>

-   Wait a few moments while the image is analyzed and confirm that it moves from **"Pending"** to the **"Succeeded/No Errors"** state.
-   Now that your definition has been created, you can delete the resource group where you spun up the VM used to capture the custom image.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block;"><img src="./media/image34.png" width="50%" /></div>

# Lab 7 Clean-Up

To avoid any unexpected charges, **ensure that your dev boxes are deleted** if you are not using them for
a while.
Return to your main browser window with your Admin account and **clear out any resources that you no longer need**.

If you disabled any Azure AD security features to move through the lab quicker, **this is the time to re-enable them.**
If you would like to keep resources deployed, ensure that you **stop the Dev Box instances via the Dev Box Portal**.

**Thank you for completing the lab!**

# Lab 8 Already finished? Optional Bonus activities!

## Try App Templates

App Templates can help you quickly deploy a specific solution including demo code to an Azure environment from a GitHub repo.

-   Using App Templates with Microsoft Dev Box allows you to demo the end-to-end developer experience as well as the Azure deployment.
-   Try deploying an App Template and pulling its code repo in a dev box with Visual Studio installed.   

<https://github.com/microsoft/App-Templates>

## Try Infrastructure as Code

During this lab we performed most actions in the user interface, but that doesn't mean that the provisioning of a Microsoft Dev Box environment can't be automated.

Follow the instructions here to provision a Dev Box environment from scratch using Bicep: [ljtill/bicep-devbox: Microsoft Dev Box platform built with Azure Bicep including GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/ljtill/bicep-devbox/)

More samples here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Devcenter
